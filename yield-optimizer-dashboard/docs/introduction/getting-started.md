# Getting Started

Welcome to the Yield Optimizer Dashboard documentation. This guide will help you get started with our platform and understand its core features.

## What is Yield Optimizer Dashboard?

Yield Optimizer Dashboard is a sophisticated DeFi management platform that enables users to optimize their yield farming strategies across multiple protocols. It provides a seamless experience for managing Separately Managed Account (SMAs) and monitoring yield performance.

## Key Features

- Real-time APY tracking across multiple protocols
- Separately Managed Account (SMA) management
- Automated yield optimization
- Historical performance analysis
- Multi-protocol integration

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Software
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or another Web3 wallet
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Stable internet connection

### Required Assets
- ETH for gas fees
- Supported tokens for investment

## Quick Start

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

```javascript
// Example of wallet connection
const connectWallet = async () => {
  try {
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
      method: 'eth_requestAccounts'
    });
    return accounts[0];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting wallet:', error);
  }
};
```

### 2. View Current Rates

Navigate to the Rates tab to view real-time APY rates across different protocols. You can filter by:
- Assets (USDC, ETH, etc.)
- Protocols (Aave, Compound, Lido, etc.)
- Time intervals

### 3. Create a Smart Money Account

1. Navigate to the SMA tab
2. Click "Create New SMA"
3. Review the deployment fee
4. Confirm the transaction

### 4. Manage Your SMA

#### Transfer Assets
```javascript
// Example of asset transfer
const transferAssets = async (amount, token) => {
  // Transfer logic here
};
```

#### Invest Assets
```javascript
// Example of investment
const investAssets = async (amount, protocol, token) => {
  // Investment logic here
};
```

## Understanding the Interface

### Main Components

1. **Header**
   - Wallet connection
   - Navigation tabs
   - Network status

2. **Rates View**
   - Current APY rates
   - Historical charts
   - Protocol filters

3. **SMA Dashboard**
   - Account overview
   - Balance tracking
   - Transaction history

### Key Concepts

#### Smart Money Accounts (SMAs)
SMAs are smart contracts that manage your assets and optimize yields across different protocols.

#### Active Management
The automated system that:
- Monitors rates
- Rebalances positions
- Optimizes yields

#### Protocol Integration
Supported protocols include:
- Aave
- Compound
- Lido
- Rocket Pool
- StakeWise

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never share private keys
- Verify all transactions
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

### Performance
- Monitor gas prices
- Use the refresh button to update rates
- Consider transaction timing

### Optimization
- Keep browser updated
- Clear cache if experiencing issues
- Use stable internet connection
